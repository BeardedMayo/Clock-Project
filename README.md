//Description: This repository contains the files for the clock program I wrote in CS 210. This README file contains information on the program as well as my reflections on building it.

//Summarize the project and what problem it was solving: This project was to build a clock that the user can adjust. It is not a working clock and doesn't tell actual time but contains all the functionality of a clock including adding hours, minutes, and seconds. The clock displays in both 12 hour and 24 hour formats. While the program itself doesn't necessarily solve any problems per se, it is a starting foundation for building a working clock on a website or other program.
//What did you do particularly well? What I enjoyed about this project was that I built it from scratch myself and it was the first project I coded in Visual Studio instead of another IDE. I felt I did well on creating the functions and the display...and it runs!
//Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? Building classes for the functions in this program would have made it more secure, easier to read, and easier to adjust/maintain.
//Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? I actually found the display the most difficult to get right. I have a friend who is a developer and he helped me with th code and taught me a few tricks on alignment and printing displays. I actually learned a lot from him and he's kind of a mentor for me.
//What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? Definitely building multiple functions and the display. I'll be able to use these skills in other programming languages as well.
//How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? As mentioned earlier, it could be more adaptable if I had used classes. As it is righ now, changing a portion of the code would require changing all of the code. I did try to keep the functions simple and easy to read. One of my goals is to make my code more "clean" and easier to read/use for the next person.
